Updated version of the CoverLoader script by Kevin HÃ¤ndel to work with SinusBot v1.0.0

You can use this script just like the original. To update the script please do the following steps:
- download the script 
- replace the original in your sinusbot/scripts folder.
- restart your sinusbot service to reload all scripts

The settings are the same as in the original script.
