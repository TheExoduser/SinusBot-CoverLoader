# SinusBot-CoverLoader

Updated version of the CoverLoader script by Kevin HÃ¤ndel to work with SinusBot v1.0.0

To use this version, just download the script and replace the original in your sinusbot/scripts folder.
Afterwards just restart your sinusbot service to reload all scripts end re-enable the script.
The settings are the same as in the original script.
